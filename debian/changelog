bfgminer (3.0.0-0precise1) precise; urgency=low

  * New device driver for ASIC devices, including both Butterfly Labs' BitForce SC and Avalon.
  * Enhanced device driver API, enabling devices to asynchronously handle multiple slave processors. Use --show-processors to view each individually (not yet supported for Avalon).
  * You can now use --request-diff <difficulty> to ask for a specific share target from pools that support BIP 23 GBT Basic Pool Extensions.
  * Support for submitting found blocks to a local Bitcoin GBT server (bitcoind or Bitcoin-Qt with -server flag): just append #allblocks to the end of your bitcoind's URI.
  * Stratum connection resuming support - if you lose an active stratum connection, BFGMiner will attempt to resubmit any lost shares when it reconnects.
  * Android target support. You will have to compile it yourself, but it should just work - no patching needed.
  * New Python RPC client example from Christian Berendt.

bfgminer (2.10.1-0precise1) precise; urgency=low

  * modminer: Enable frequency adjustments up to 230 MHz, and allow changing the frequency (non-sticky) via the new "pgaset" RPC command.
  * Numerous stratum fixes, including failover recovery. Also allow using stratum with scrypt.

bfgminer (2.10.0-0precise1) precise; urgency=low

  * Avoid fetching more GBT jobs when we already have a usable one, or are already in the process of getting a new one that will suffice. This drastically improves efficiency on GBT pools and reduces unnecessary bandwidth waste.
  * Share submissions are now processed asyncronously in parallel, in a single dedicated thread, instead of spawning a new thread for every submission. This makes BFGMiner scale better to bigger rigs with more shares, and enables it to react to network outages better. Additionally, a new "AS" (Active Submissions) number has been added to the status line to make it easy to see at a glance what's going on.
  * New --skip-security-checks option to allow miners to skip checks when it saves bandwidth (stratum).
  * Additional extranonce to count template requests for GBT solo mining, to ensure we never work on hashing the same data redundantly.
  * Con's new work scheduler: The old work scheduler would spawn threads that all tried to grab work as best as they could, and this would lead to much more work than necessary being grabbed from getwork pools, and potentially hitting the pool at precisely the same time from multiple threads making a getwork failure more likely. It was also very difficult to track how much work was really available at any one time since all the threads were off doing their own thing. Centralising the work creation means it is strictly tracked now and as soon as one work item is taken, the scheduler will generate or download another one. The advantage here is to maximise the efficiency of work we get from any getwork source, be it with or without rolltime. It is also much less likely to have dips in providing work, should lead to less getwork failures, and scale to higher hashrates even with the old getwork protocols.
  * When the primary pool is stratum, GBT, or getwork in failover mode, no backup connections will be maintained to backup pools. The total number of unused stratum connections now should be extremely small.
  * Ztex driver improvements courtesy of Denis and Peter.
  * Lots of work under the hood and other minor goodies. Check full changelog.

bfgminer (2.7.0-0precise1) precise; urgency=low

  * The main change in this version is a complete rewrite of the getwork requesting mechanism. Con had been slowly hacking away at the old one for some time, but finally gave up in disgust and has rewritten it to some extent. Previously, mining threads would occasionally throw out a request for more work, some arbitrary test would be done on whether more work should be requested, and it handed off the message to another thread which spawned another thread and that then sent the request and so on. Worse yet it was hard to find the right place to reuse work and so it was never reused to its utmost potential. The rewrite involves scheduling a new request based on the rate the old work items get used up, and is much better at predicting when it needs to leak work to backup pools and less likely to throw a "pool is not providing work fast enough" message. Overall you should now see much more Local Work (LW), the efficiency will be higher on pools that support rolltime, less work will be discarded, any magnitude rig will be kept solidly busy - note this MAY mean your overclocks will become that much more stressed if you have set clocks very aggressively. Thanks to Con and the numerous people who tested this during its development phase.
  * New pool strategy: Balance.
  * With the change to queueing and more roll work being possible than ever before, the imbalance between pools that support rolltime and those that don't will now be extreme in load balance strategy. To offset that, and since the number of people using load balance has been increasing, the new strategy was added to try and give roughly the same number of shares to each pool.
  * Other minor bugfixes.

bfgminer (2.6.5-0precise1) precise; urgency=low

  * New BitFORCE firmware flash utility. When compiled with BitFORCE support, run `bitforce-firmware-flash` to get usage.
  * Fixed hanging when using "Switch User" on Windows. This feature still kills ADL, though, so use --no-restart (and don't enable fan control or overclocking) if you plan to use it.
  * Fixed dynamic mode on Windows. By default, Windows timer resolution is only 15ms and we're trying to sample much smaller than that. This was leading to the time taken to do GPU work appearing as zero for many samples. Now, a Windows multimedia timing API will be used to request more precision.
  * gpu-memdiff should now take effect when you change gpu engine clock from the menu as well.
  * The ADL gpu-map feature should work now when you have more ADL devices than OpenCL (eg, ATI cards that don't support OpenCL).
  * More tweaks to the queueing mechanism to increase efficiency and keep minirigs fully work laden.
  * Failover-only can now be changed via the RPC API.
  * Updated miner.php from Kano

bfgminer (2.6.4-0precise1) precise; urgency=low

  * More drastic improvements to ModMiner clock adjustment algorithm. Downclocking should be more conservative, and BFGMiner will even raise the clock speed when it's doing well.
  * ModMiners are now kept busier (less idle time) and nonces are checked against the previous work to catch races. This may result in a higher utility (effective hashrate).
  * Tested and fixed problems managing throttling BitFORCE Singles. An 880 MH/s Single that was throttling to 440 MH/s before (and throwing lots of garbled errors) is now working cleanly at 590 MH/s - a 34% improvement in hashrate!
  * A bunch of annoying crashes were fixed:
  * * With high-share devices when network connectivity is lost.
  * * GPU mining not functional when any OpenCL platform fails.
  * * Occasional deadlock/hang during exit.
  * New --debuglog option to include debug information in log file (see README) but not in main console.
  * The scrypt code was updated - now ALL results from a GPU are checked to see if they're valid and if not, instead of being submitted where they are guaranteed to be rejected, they register as hardware errors. This will make tuning your scrypt parameters easier as HW error count will rise if you've set the parameters too high.
  * Updated miner.php from Kano

bfgminer (2.6.3-1precise1) precise; urgency=medium
  Version 2.6.3 - August 6, 2012

  * First release to attempt Debian packaging.
  * Complete rewrite of the queueing mechanism which gets new work from the pools. The code in that section had gotten out of hand and become a "state machine" that was difficult to model its behaviour and occasionally led to stalls during startup and what-not without work and perhaps queued too much work in general. Now it monitors carefully the amount of queued and available work on a pool-by-pool basis and only queues when needed, but tries hard to make sure it doesn't run empty. You will notice the the TQ value now hovers around zero when all is well, and only jumps up transiently, all going well. Hopefully the efficiency is even higher now too. Detection of pool lag should be more accurate now, and less shares should leak to backup pools now as well.
  * Numerous bugfixes and workarounds for ModMiner driver, bringing it to a functional level even on Windows.
  * Scrypt support enabled for Windows binaries.
  * Can set failover-only mode now from the menu during runtime.
  * One-shot schedules (exactly one of --sched-stop or --sched-start) now handle times beyond midnight properly.
  * ModMiner now shows bitstream upload in summary line rather than spamming the log (progress is still logged every 10% for timestamps).
  * The RPC API should be able to bind to the port immediately on linux now instead of having to wait 60 seconds as it used to.
  * Proper big endian (routers) support, including fixing and enabling functionality that crashed before.
  * Minimal support for the Enterpoint's Cairnsmore1 FPGA mining board.
  * Throttling episodes on bitforce devices will now perform reasonably (given the circumstances) and/or register as HW errors.
  * Support for all FPGA drivers enabled by default when compiling from source.
