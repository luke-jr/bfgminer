bfgminer (5.0.0-0precise1) precise; urgency=low

  * Multi-blockchain support: BFGMiner can now be told which pools use the same "mining goals", and will track the blockchain independently for ones that don't. This allows you to mine multiple cryptocurrencies concurrently using any pool strategy (including balance and load-balance).
  * Multi-algorithm support: BFGMiner is now capable of hashing on both scrypt and SHA256d work at the same time, and you can assign the mining algorithm to use on a per-goal basis. As with multi-blockchain support, this works even in balancing strategies. Note that at this time, only CPU, OpenCL, and Proxy drivers actually support multiple algorithms at the same time (DualMiner must be preconfigured for only one, and GridSeed remains scrypt-only).
  * Stratum extensions for mining goals: New experimental methods mining.capabilities and mining.set_goal for Stratum allow you to expose control of the mining algorithm to the pool. These extensions are considered draft and may be changed based on the needs of multiblockchain pool operators.
  * RPC: Also extended for multiple mining goals/algorithms. Interface is subject to change.
  * kncasic: New driver for KnCMiner Neptune (and 2nd-gen Jupiter modules).
  * minion: New driver for BlackArrow Prospero X1.5.
  * titan: Work flushing optimisations from KnCMiner, and reduce processor view from per-core to per-die.
  * Keccak: Support for the SHA-3 winner hash as a proof-of-work algorithm.
  * opencl: Workaround broken global work offset support in buggy drivers.
  * opencl: GPU mining is now disabled by default for scrypt. Use -S opencl:auto to enable it.

  * Various options (specifically, --temp-cutoff, --temp-target, and the various --<driver>-options) have been migrated to the --set-device interface.
  * Automatic hotplug support for Linux and Windows.
  * TUI: Redesigned pool information line to include share difficulties in multipool modes and timestamp of the last explicit work update (which are no longer logged).

  * dualminer: New driver, supporting both SHA256d and scrypt ASIC mining.
  * gridseed: New driver, supporting only scrypt ASIC mining.
  * hashbusteravalon: New driver for Avalon2-based HashBuster devices, such as the HashBuster Alpha.
  * hashfast: Display of temperature and voltage, as well as setting clock frequency at startup.
  * icarus & cairnsmore: Since Block Erupters are far more popular, and less unprofitable, the erupter driver is now preferred over icarus and cairnsmore drivers. This means you must change -S all to -S icarus:all or -S cairnsmore:all.
  * knc: Added a use_dcdc setting that can be used on Nov batch units to avoid triggering DCDC problems (--set knc:use_dcdc=no).
  * nanofury: Support for new, multi-chip NF2 and NF6 units.
  * RPC: cpu* and gpu* commands have all been deprecated; CPUs and GPUs are now accessible using pga* and proc* commands just like everything else.
  * Stratum proxy: Support for GBT upstream pools, as well as scrypt algorithm.
  * getwork proxy: Support for scrypt and included in Win64 binaries.
  * opencl: Major updating of code to use set-device interfaces.
  * opencl: Support for loading kernels by filename, provided they use a known interface. Loading most scrypt kernel should just work, and most SHA2 kernels can be enabled by adding a single comment to the CL source.
  * opencl: Support for new "xintensity" unit by using --set-device OCL:intensity=x5 (for example).
  * opencl: Raise max scrypt GPU intensity to 31, and enabled driver by default for scrypt.
  * opencl: Add some optimised scrypt kernels by zuikkis and psw.
  * scrypt: Fixed nonce-based (third) hashrate, and display sub-one share difficulties.
  * Default log interval (and first hashrate rolling average) increased from 5 seconds to 20 seconds to make it more useful.
  * Benchmark mode refactored to work for both SHA256d and scrypt, and with the third hashrate.
  * Many uncommon options (including CPU and GPU mining related ones) have had their "shorthand" forms deprecated. A future release will remove (and perhaps redefine) these shorthands entirely.
  * Bundled a start-bfgminer.sh shell script for *nix which will start/restart BFGMiner in a screen session, and can safely be used in init/cron tasks.

bfgminer (3.7.0-0precise1) precise; urgency=low

  * Support for new Bi*fury and Twinfury mining devices.
  * Device probing has been rewritten to scan all devices in parallel (much faster). As a result, the order of devices found is no longer deterministic (consistent) at all.
  * Parallel device probing makes --device's former syntax unusable, so it has been modified to use the same pattern matching as --set-device. Note that things like --scan-serial ztex:all are now valid, but probably much more dangerous than with VCOM drivers; a bare driverless "all" only affects VCOM drivers for this reason.
  * Pattern matching for --set-device (and now --device) supports identifying specific devices by serial number or path. To use this, insert either of these between @ symbols where you would have previously put an index. So for example, --device 'BFL@FTWOTOP4' (bitforce device with serial FTWOTOP4) or  --set-device '@/dev/ttyUSB0@a:osc6_bits=52' (first processor of device on /dev/ttyUSB0).
  * BFGMiner-written config files now include the scan-serial and set-device settings.
  * cpu and opencl drivers have been disabled by default in all cases. Use -S cpu:auto or -S opencl:auto if you need them.
  * Automatically workaround cgminer driver breakage on Linux.

  * New drivers for KnC miners and NanoFury USB miners.
  * Per-chip dynamic osc6_bits detection for BFSB, MegaBigPower, and Metabank bitfury boards.
  * Ability to set default options for various devices using --set-device commandline option; for example, if you have all your NanoFury miners in a USB 3 hub (with 900 mA power available), you can increase the oscillator speed with: --set-device NFY:osc6_bits=53 (or "set-device":["NFY:osc6_bits=53"] in a config file).
  * Con Kolivas's completely rewritten load-balance strategy with per pool quota support. See the updated README to see how it works.
  * If we switch away from a pool in failover mode, we will now only switch back to it if it's up for at least 5 minutes to avoid reconnecting to pools that are only intermittently up - good for DDoS situations which we've seen a lot of lately. (by Con Kolivas)
  * Updated miner.php from Kano.
  * Proxy settings now default to SOCKS5 instead of SOCKS4. Prefix your proxy IP with "socks4://" if you need to use the older protocol.

  * New drivers for bitfury-based devices: BFSB/MegaBigPower(v2 only!) kits, Big Picture Mining USB (BF1, RedFury, BlueFury, etc), LittleFury, and Metabank. See README.ASIC for setup instructions.
  * Support for proxy virtual devices has been extended to include the stratum protocol when the upstream pool selected is also stratum and supplies sufficient extranonce2 space. If the upstream pool does not meet this criteria, stratum clients will be disconnected and new ones will fail to subscribe. You can take advantage of this to failover to the getwork proxy. Support for upstream getwork pools is impossble, but GBT is planned.
  * opencl: Driver is disabled by default if FPGAs or ASICs are detected. To enable, use -S opencl:auto
  * Third hashrate displayed is now based on nonces found, adjusted for pool rejected/stale shares. It should still be approximately equivalent to your effective/earning hashrate, but with better accuracy.
  * Utility on the TUI status line has been replaced with expected Income, measured as 100% PPS BTC per hour for easy comparison with electric costs.
  * RPC: Methods shared with cgminer now only consider entire devices, to be more compatible. A set of new processor-detail methods have been added to get full information per-processor.
  * RPC: Old devdetail method has been made compatible with cgminer devdetails and renamed.
  * New options --chroot-dir and --setuid on POSIX systems (thanks Ricardo!).

  * bitforce: Display voltages in Manage device TUI.
  * Reorganised TUI display, adding network transfer rate, and totals summary line including count of total devices/processors hashing as well as hottest temperature across all sensors.
  * Improved timer functionality under the hood, taking advantage of clock_gettime. This should fix issues (eg, erupters reporting insane hashrates) related to system clock changes (such as NTP drift adjustment).
  * Removed blank/wasted lines above/below log window in TUI mode.

  * RPC: New "devscan" command to probe for new devices on demand. The effect is the same as starting BFGMiner with -S noauto -S <parameter>.
  * TUI: Display percentage invalid of found nonces with hw errors.
  * cpu & opencl: These legacy drivers now respect the --scan-serial auto/noauto directives, and the old -C (enable CPU) and -G (disable GPU) options are now deprecated.

bfgminer (2.10.4-0precise1) precise; urgency=low

  * Better big-endian compatibility.
  * Kano's RPC example is now included as the bfgminer-rpc program.
  * Improved bitstream for ModMiners, with gains of about 10 Mh/s on average. This was originally supposed to be part of BFGMiner 2.9.2, but somehow slipped through the cracks! You'll need to power cycle your board, or use the --force-dev-init option to upload the new bitstream.
  * Many bugfixes and some small improvements all over.

bfgminer (2.10.1-0precise1) precise; urgency=low

  * modminer: Enable frequency adjustments up to 230 MHz, and allow changing the frequency (non-sticky) via the new "pgaset" RPC command.
  * Numerous stratum fixes, including failover recovery. Also allow using stratum with scrypt.
  * Replaced the work-based efficiency with new bandwidth-based efficiency.

bfgminer (2.10.0-0precise1) precise; urgency=low

  * Avoid fetching more GBT jobs when we already have a usable one, or are already in the process of getting a new one that will suffice. This drastically improves efficiency on GBT pools and reduces unnecessary bandwidth waste.
  * Share submissions are now processed asyncronously in parallel, in a single dedicated thread, instead of spawning a new thread for every submission. This makes BFGMiner scale better to bigger rigs with more shares, and enables it to react to network outages better. Additionally, a new "AS" (Active Submissions) number has been added to the status line to make it easy to see at a glance what's going on.
  * New --skip-security-checks option to allow miners to skip checks when it saves bandwidth (stratum).
  * Additional extranonce to count template requests for GBT solo mining, to ensure we never work on hashing the same data redundantly.
  * Con's new work scheduler: The old work scheduler would spawn threads that all tried to grab work as best as they could, and this would lead to much more work than necessary being grabbed from getwork pools, and potentially hitting the pool at precisely the same time from multiple threads making a getwork failure more likely. It was also very difficult to track how much work was really available at any one time since all the threads were off doing their own thing. Centralising the work creation means it is strictly tracked now and as soon as one work item is taken, the scheduler will generate or download another one. The advantage here is to maximise the efficiency of work we get from any getwork source, be it with or without rolltime. It is also much less likely to have dips in providing work, should lead to less getwork failures, and scale to higher hashrates even with the old getwork protocols.
  * When the primary pool is stratum, GBT, or getwork in failover mode, no backup connections will be maintained to backup pools. The total number of unused stratum connections now should be extremely small.
  * Ztex driver improvements courtesy of Denis and Peter.
  * Lots of work under the hood and other minor goodies. Check full changelog.

  * OpenCL: Updated kernels which should allow ultra low memory speeds once again (idea courtesy of Vbs).
  * Stratum support by Con.
  * BFGMiner now tries to actually catch crashes and unless the --no-restart option is given, it will try to restart cleanly.
  * OpenCL: Scrypt will now not fail when setting high thread concurrency values that still return some RAM even if OpenCL returns an error on that RAM allocation.

  * Very high hashrate (U > 100) machines should now be able to work unhindered even on pools that don't support rolltime.
  * The --retry-pause/-R option no longer does anything and is deprecated in preference for faster communications and simpler code.
  * -r was removed as a shortcut for --retries.
  * Hopefully the dynamic mode for GPUs is fixed on windows.
  * Hopefully the 7 day windows crash bug has been fixed

bfgminer (2.7.0-0precise1) precise; urgency=low

  * The main change in this version is a complete rewrite of the getwork requesting mechanism. Con had been slowly hacking away at the old one for some time, but finally gave up in disgust and has rewritten it to some extent. Previously, mining threads would occasionally throw out a request for more work, some arbitrary test would be done on whether more work should be requested, and it handed off the message to another thread which spawned another thread and that then sent the request and so on. Worse yet it was hard to find the right place to reuse work and so it was never reused to its utmost potential. The rewrite involves scheduling a new request based on the rate the old work items get used up, and is much better at predicting when it needs to leak work to backup pools and less likely to throw a "pool is not providing work fast enough" message. Overall you should now see much more Local Work (LW), the efficiency will be higher on pools that support rolltime, less work will be discarded, any magnitude rig will be kept solidly busy - note this MAY mean your overclocks will become that much more stressed if you have set clocks very aggressively. Thanks to Con and the numerous people who tested this during its development phase.
  * New pool strategy: Balance.
  * With the change to queueing and more roll work being possible than ever before, the imbalance between pools that support rolltime and those that don't will now be extreme in load balance strategy. To offset that, and since the number of people using load balance has been increasing, the new strategy was added to try and give roughly the same number of shares to each pool.
  * Other minor bugfixes.

bfgminer (2.6.5-0precise1) precise; urgency=low

  * New BitFORCE firmware flash utility. When compiled with BitFORCE support, run `bitforce-firmware-flash` to get usage.
  * Fixed hanging when using "Switch User" on Windows. This feature still kills ADL, though, so use --no-restart (and don't enable fan control or overclocking) if you plan to use it.
  * Fixed dynamic mode on Windows. By default, Windows timer resolution is only 15ms and we're trying to sample much smaller than that. This was leading to the time taken to do GPU work appearing as zero for many samples. Now, a Windows multimedia timing API will be used to request more precision.
  * gpu-memdiff should now take effect when you change gpu engine clock from the menu as well.
  * The ADL gpu-map feature should work now when you have more ADL devices than OpenCL (eg, ATI cards that don't support OpenCL).
  * More tweaks to the queueing mechanism to increase efficiency and keep minirigs fully work laden.
  * Failover-only can now be changed via the RPC API.
  * Updated miner.php from Kano

bfgminer (2.6.4-0precise1) precise; urgency=low

  * More drastic improvements to ModMiner clock adjustment algorithm. Downclocking should be more conservative, and BFGMiner will even raise the clock speed when it's doing well.
  * ModMiners are now kept busier (less idle time) and nonces are checked against the previous work to catch races. This may result in a higher utility (effective hashrate).
  * Tested and fixed problems managing throttling BitFORCE Singles. An 880 MH/s Single that was throttling to 440 MH/s before (and throwing lots of garbled errors) is now working cleanly at 590 MH/s - a 34% improvement in hashrate!
  * A bunch of annoying crashes were fixed:
  * * With high-share devices when network connectivity is lost.
  * * GPU mining not functional when any OpenCL platform fails.
  * * Occasional deadlock/hang during exit.
  * New --debuglog option to include debug information in log file (see README) but not in main console.
  * The scrypt code was updated - now ALL results from a GPU are checked to see if they're valid and if not, instead of being submitted where they are guaranteed to be rejected, they register as hardware errors. This will make tuning your scrypt parameters easier as HW error count will rise if you've set the parameters too high.
  * Updated miner.php from Kano

bfgminer (2.6.3.2-0precise2) precise; urgency=low

  * Switched to a Debian native package so that building minor packaging versions is easier.
  * Dropped debhelper reqs to version 7, so we can build on Lucid.

 -- graeme <graeme@sudo.ca>  Wed, 08 Aug 2012 11:11:28 -0700

bfgminer (2.6.3-1precise1) precise; urgency=medium
  Version 2.6.3 - August 6, 2012

  * First release to attempt Debian packaging.
  * Complete rewrite of the queueing mechanism which gets new work from the pools. The code in that section had gotten out of hand and become a "state machine" that was difficult to model its behaviour and occasionally led to stalls during startup and what-not without work and perhaps queued too much work in general. Now it monitors carefully the amount of queued and available work on a pool-by-pool basis and only queues when needed, but tries hard to make sure it doesn't run empty. You will notice the the TQ value now hovers around zero when all is well, and only jumps up transiently, all going well. Hopefully the efficiency is even higher now too. Detection of pool lag should be more accurate now, and less shares should leak to backup pools now as well.
  * Numerous bugfixes and workarounds for ModMiner driver, bringing it to a functional level even on Windows.
  * Scrypt support enabled for Windows binaries.
  * Can set failover-only mode now from the menu during runtime.
  * One-shot schedules (exactly one of --sched-stop or --sched-start) now handle times beyond midnight properly.
  * ModMiner now shows bitstream upload in summary line rather than spamming the log (progress is still logged every 10% for timestamps).
  * The RPC API should be able to bind to the port immediately on linux now instead of having to wait 60 seconds as it used to.
  * Proper big endian (routers) support, including fixing and enabling functionality that crashed before.
  * Minimal support for the Enterpoint's Cairnsmore1 FPGA mining board.
  * Throttling episodes on bitforce devices will now perform reasonably (given the circumstances) and/or register as HW errors.
  * Support for all FPGA drivers enabled by default when compiling from source.
