This README contains details about the cgminer RPC API


If you start cgminer with the "--api-listen" option, it will listen on a
simple TCP/IP socket for single string API requests from the same machine
running cgminer and reply with a string and then close the socket each time
If you add the "--api-network" option, it will accept API requests from any
network attached computer.

You can only access the comands that reply with data in this mode.
By default, you cannot access any privileged command that affects the miner -
you will receive an access denied status message see --api-allow below.

You can specify IP addresses/prefixes that are only allowed to access the API
with the "--api-allow" option e.g. --api-allow W:192.168.0.1,10.0.0/24
will allow 192.168.0.1 or any address matching 10.0.0.*, but nothing else
IP addresses are automatically padded with extra '.0's as needed
Without a /prefix is the same as specifying /32
0/0 means all IP addresses.
The 'W:' on the front gives that address/subnet privileged access to commands
that modify cgminer (thus all API commands)
Without it those commands return an access denied status.
See --api-groups below to define other groups like W:
Privileged access is checked in the order the IP addresses were supplied to
"--api-allow"
The first match determines the privilege level.
Using the "--api-allow" option overides the "--api-network" option if they
are both specified
With "--api-allow", 127.0.0.1 is not by default given access unless specified

More groups (like the privileged group W:) can be defined using the
--api-groups command
Valid groups are only the letters A-Z (except R & W are predefined) and are
not case sensitive
The R: group is the same as not privileged access
The W: group is (as stated) privileged access (thus all API commands)
To give an IP address/subnet access to a group you use the group letter
in front of the IP address instead of W: e.g. P:192.168.0/32
An IP address/subnet can only be a member of one group
A sample API group would be:
 --api-groups P:switchpool:enablepool:addpool:disablepool:removepool:*
This would create a group 'P' that can do all current pool commands and all
non-priviliged commands - the '*' means all non-priviledged commands
Without the '*' the group would only have access to the pool commands
Defining multiple groups example:
 --api-groups Q:quit:restart:*,S:save
This would define 2 groups:
 Q: that can 'quit' and 'restart' as well as all non-priviledged commands
 S: that can only 'save' and no other commands

The RPC API request can be either simple text or JSON.

If the request is JSON (starts with '{'), it will reply with a JSON formatted
response, otherwise it replies with text formatted as described further below.

The JSON request format required is '{"command":"CMD","parameter":"PARAM"}'
(though of course parameter is not required for all requests)
where "CMD" is from the "Request" column below and "PARAM" would be e.g.
the CPU/GPU number if required.

An example request in both formats to set GPU 0 fan to 80%:
  gpufan|0,80
  {"command":"gpufan","parameter":"0,80"}

The format of each reply (unless stated otherwise) is a STATUS section
followed by an optional detail section

From API version 1.7 onwards, reply strings in JSON and Text have the
necessary escaping as required to avoid ambiguity - they didn't before 1.7
For JSON the 2 characters '"' and '\' are escaped with a '\' before them
For Text the 4 characters '|' ',' '=' and '\' are escaped the same way

Only user entered information will contain characters that require being
escaped, such as Pool URL, User and Password or the Config save filename,
when they are returned in messages or as their values by the API

For API version 1.4 and later:

The STATUS section is:

 STATUS=X,When=NNN,Code=N,Msg=string,Description=string|

  STATUS=X Where X is one of:
   W - Warning
   I - Informational
   S - Success
   E - Error
   F - Fatal (code bug)

  When=NNN
   Standard long time of request in seconds

  Code=N
   Each unique reply has a unigue Code (See api.c - #define MSG_NNNNNN)

  Msg=string
   Message matching the Code value N

  Description=string
   This defaults to the cgminer version but is the value of --api-description
   if it was specified at runtime.

For API version 1.10 and later:

The list of requests - a (*) means it requires privileged access - and replies are:

 devdetails    DEVDETAILS     Each device with a list of their static details
                              This lists all devices including those not supported

 restart (*)   none           There is no status section but just a single "RESTART"
                              reply before cgminer restarts

 stats         STATS          Each device or pool that has 1 or more getworks
                              with a list of stats regarding getwork times
                              The values returned by stats may change in future
                              versions thus would not normally be displayed
                              Device drivers are also able to add stats to the
                              end of the details returned

 check|cmd     COMMAND        Exists=Y/N, <- 'cmd' exists in this version
                              Access=Y/N| <- you have access to use 'cmd'

When you enable, disable or restart a GPU or PGA, you will also get Thread messages
in the cgminer status window

When you switch to a different pool to the current one, you will get a
'Switching to URL' message in the cgminer status windows

Obviously, the JSON format is simply just the names as given before the '='
with the values after the '='

If you enable cgminer debug (-D or --debug) you will also get messages showing
details of the requests received and the replies

There are included 4 program examples for accessing the API:

api-example.php - a php script to access the API
  usAge: php api-example.php command
 by default it sends a 'summary' request to the miner at 127.0.0.1:4028
 If you specify a command it will send that request instead
 You must modify the line "$socket = getsock('127.0.0.1', 4028);" at the
 beginning of "function request($cmd)" to change where it looks for cgminer

API.java/API.class
 a java program to access the API (with source code)
  usAge is: java API command address port
 Any missing or blank parameters are replaced as if you entered:
  java API summary 127.0.0.1 4028

api-example.c - a 'C' program to access the API (with source code)
  usAge: api-example [command [ip/host [port]]]
 again, as above, missing or blank parameters are replaced as if you entered:
  api-example summary 127.0.0.1 4028

miner.php - an example web page to access the API
 This includes buttons and inputs to attempt access to the privileged commands
 Read the top of the file (miner.php) for details of how to tune the display
 and also to use the option to display a multi-rig summary
