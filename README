EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ON USAGE:

After saving configuration from the menu, you do not need to give BFGMiner any
arguments and it will load your configuration.

Any configuration file may also contain a single
	"include" : "filename"
to recursively include another configuration file.
Writing the configuration will save all settings from all files in the output.


Single pool:

bfgminer -o http://pool:port -u username -p password

Multiple pools:

bfgminer -o http://pool1:port -u pool1username -p pool1password -o http://pool2:port -u pool2usernmae -p pool2password

Single pool with a standard http proxy, regular desktop:

bfgminer -o http://pool:port -x http://proxy:port -u username -p password

Single pool with a socks5 proxy, regular desktop:

bfgminer -o http://pool:port -x socks5://proxy:port -u username -p password

The list of proxy types are:
 http:    standard http 1.1 proxy
 socks4:  socks4 proxy
 socks5:  socks5 proxy
 socks4a: socks4a proxy
 socks5h: socks5 proxy using a hostname

Proxy support requires cURL version 7.21.7 or newer.

If you specify the --socks-proxy option to BFGMiner, it will only be applied to
all pools that don't specify their own proxy setting like above

Basic *nix build instructions:

./autogen.sh    # only needed if building from git repo
./configure
make

No installation is necessary. You may run BFGMiner from the build directory
directly.

On Mac OS X, you can use Homebrew to install the dependency libraries. When you
are ready to build BFGMiner, you may need to point the configure script at one
or more pkg-config paths. For example:
	./configure PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/opt/curl/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/opt/jansson/lib/pkgconfig

Native WIN32 build instructions: see windows-build.txt

If you build BFGMiner from source, it is recommended that you run it from the
build directory. On *nix, you will usually need to prepend your command with a
path like this (if you are in the bfgminer directory already): ./bfgminer

ASIC/FPGA mining boards (BitForce, Icarus, ModMiner, X6500, ZTEX) only options:

--scan-serial|-S <arg> Serial port to probe for mining devices

To use ASICs or FPGAs, you will need to be sure the user BFGMiner is running as
has appropriate permissions. This varies by operating system.
On Gentoo: sudo usermod <username> -a -G uucp
On Ubuntu: sudo usermod <username> -a -G dialout
Note that on GNU/Linux systems, you will usually need to login again before
group changes take effect.

By default, BFGMiner will scan for autodetected devices unless at least one -S
is specified for that driver. If you specify -S and still want BFGMiner to scan,
you must also use "-S auto". If you want to prevent BFGMiner from scanning
without specifying a device, you can use "-S noauto". Note that presently,
autodetection only works on Linux, and might only detect one device depending
on the version of udev being used. If you want to scan all serial ports, you
can use "-S all"; note that this may write data to non-mining devices which may
then behave in unexpected ways!

On Linux, <arg> is usually of the format /dev/ttyUSBn
On Mac OS X, <arg> is usually of the format /dev/cu.usb*
On Windows, <arg> is usually of the format \\.\COMn
(where n = the correct device number for the device)

The official supplied binaries are compiled with support for all ASICs/FPGAs.
To force the code to only attempt detection with a specific driver,
prepend the argument with the driver name followed by a colon.
For example, "icarus:/dev/ttyUSB0" or "bitforce:\\.\COM5"
or using the short name: "ica:/dev/ttyUSB0" or "bfl:\\.\COM5"

Some FPGAs do not have non-volatile storage for their bitstreams and must be
programmed every power cycle, including first use. To use these devices, you
must download the BFGMiner source archive (bfgminer-x.y.z.zip) and copy the
"bitstreams" directory into your BFGMiner application directory.

See README.ASIC and README.FPGA for more information regarding these.

CPU only options (not included in binaries):

--algo|-a <arg>     Specify sha256 implementation for CPU mining:
        fastauto*       Quick benchmark at startup to pick a working algorithm
        auto            Benchmark at startup and pick fastest algorithm
        c               Linux kernel sha256, implemented in C

MULTIPOOL

FAILOVER STRATEGIES WITH MULTIPOOL:
A number of different strategies for dealing with multipool setups are
available. Each has their advantages and disadvantages so multiple strategies
are available by user choice, as per the following list:

FAILOVER:
The default strategy is failover. This means that if you input a number of
pools, it will try to use them as a priority list, moving away from the 1st
to the 2nd, 2nd to 3rd and so on. If any of the earlier pools recover, it will
move back to the higher priority ones.

ROUND ROBIN:
This strategy only moves from one pool to the next when the current one falls
idle and makes no attempt to move otherwise.

ROTATE:
This strategy moves at user-defined intervals from one active pool to the next,
skipping pools that are idle.

LOAD BALANCE:
This strategy sends work to all the pools to maintain optimum load. The most
efficient pools will tend to get a lot more shares. If any pool falls idle, the
rest will tend to take up the slack keeping the miner busy.

BALANCE:
This strategy monitors the amount of difficulty 1 shares solved for each pool
and uses it to try to end up doing the same amount of work for all pools.


---
SOLO MINING

BFGMiner supports solo mining with any GBT-compatible bitcoin node (such as
bitcoind). To use this mode, you need to specify the URL of your bitcoind node
using the usual pool options (--url, --userpass, etc), and the --coinbase-addr
option to specify the Bitcoin address you wish to receive the block rewards
mined. If you are solo mining with more than one instance of BFGMiner (or any
other software) per payout address, you must also specify data using the
--coinbase-sig option to ensure each miner is working on unique work. Note
that this data will be publicly seen if your miner finds a block using any
GBT-enabled pool, even when not solo mining (such as failover). If your
bitcoin node does not support longpolling (for example, bitcoind 0.7.x), you
should consider setting up a failover pool to provide you with block
notifications.

Example solo mining usage:

bfgminer -o http://localhost:8332 -u username -p password \
    --coinbase-addr 1QATWksNFGeUJCWBrN4g6hGM178Lovm7Wh \
    --coinbase-sig "rig1: This is Joe's block!"


---
LOGGING

BFGMiner will log to stderr if it detects stderr is being redirected to a file.
To enable logging simply add 2>logfile.txt to your command line and logfile.txt
will contain the logged output at the log level you specify (normal, verbose,
debug etc.)

In other words if you would normally use:
./bfgminer -o xxx -u yyy -p zzz
if you use
./bfgminer -o xxx -u yyy -p zzz 2>logfile.txt
it will log to a file called logfile.txt and otherwise work the same.

There is also the -m option on linux which will spawn a command of your choice
and pipe the output directly to that command.

The WorkTime details 'debug' option adds details on the end of each line
displayed for Accepted or Rejected work done. An example would be:

 <-00000059.ed4834a3 M:X D:1.0 G:17:02:38:0.405 C:1.855 (2.995) W:3.440 (0.000) S:0.461 R:17:02:47

The first 2 hex codes are the previous block hash, the rest are reported in
seconds unless stated otherwise:
The previous hash is followed by the getwork mode used M:X where X is one of
P:Pool, T:Test Pool, L:LP or B:Benchmark,
then D:d.ddd is the difficulty required to get a share from the work,
then G:hh:mm:ss:n.nnn, which is when the getwork or LP was sent to the pool and
the n.nnn is how long it took to reply,
followed by 'O' on its own if it is an original getwork, or 'C:n.nnn' if it was
a clone with n.nnn stating how long after the work was recieved that it was
cloned, (m.mmm) is how long from when the original work was received until work
started,
W:n.nnn is how long the work took to process until it was ready to submit,
(m.mmm) is how long from ready to submit to actually doing the submit, this is
usually 0.000 unless there was a problem with submitting the work,
S:n.nnn is how long it took to submit the completed work and await the reply,
R:hh:mm:ss is the actual time the work submit reply was received

If you start BFGMiner with the --sharelog option, you can get detailed
information for each share found. The argument to the option may be "-" for
standard output (not advisable with the ncurses UI), any valid positive number
for that file descriptor, or a filename.

To log share data to a file named "share.log", you can use either:
./bfgminer --sharelog 50 -o xxx -u yyy -p zzz 50>share.log
./bfgminer --sharelog share.log -o xxx -u yyy -p zzz

FAQ

Q: Why can't BFGMiner find lib<something> even after I installed it from source
code?
A: On UNIX-like operating systems, you often need to run some command to reload
its library caches such as "ldconfig" or similar. A couple of systems (such as
Fedora) ship with /usr/local/lib missing from their library search path. In
this case, you can usually add it like this:
    echo /usr/local/lib >/etc/ld.so.conf.d/local.conf
Please note that if your libraries installed into lib64 instead of lib, you
should use that in the ld.so config file above instead.

Q: BFGMiner segfaults when I change my shell window size.
A: Older versions of libncurses have a bug to do with refreshing a window
after a size change. Upgrading to a new version of curses will fix it.

Q: Can I mine on servers from different networks (eg smartcoin and bitcoin) at
the same time?
A: No, BFGMiner keeps a database of the block it's working on to ensure it does
not work on stale blocks, and having different blocks from two networks would
make it invalidate the work from each other.

Q: Can I configure BFGMiner to mine with different login credentials or pools
for each separate device?
A: No.

Q: Can I put multiple pools in the config file?
A: Yes, check the example.conf file. Alternatively, set up everything either on
the command line or via the menu after startup and choose settings->write
config file and the file will be loaded one each startup.

Q: The build fails with gcc is unable to build a binary.
A: Remove the "-march=native" component of your CFLAGS as your version of GCC
does not support it.

Q: Can you implement feature X?
A: I can, but time is limited, and people who donate are more likely to get
their feature requests implemented.

Q: Work keeps going to my backup pool even though my primary pool hasn't
failed?
A: BFGMiner checks for conditions where the primary pool is lagging and will
pass some work to the backup servers under those conditions. The reason for
doing this is to try its absolute best to keep the GPUs working on something
useful and not risk idle periods. You can disable this behaviour with the
option --failover-only.

Q: Is this a virus?
A: BFGMiner is being packaged with other trojan scripts and some antivirus
software is falsely accusing bfgminer.exe as being the actual virus, rather
than whatever it is being packaged with. If you installed BFGMiner yourself,
then you do not have a virus on your computer. Complain to your antivirus
software company. They seem to be flagging even source code now from BFGMiner
as viruses, even though text source files can't do anything by themself.

Q: Can you modify the display to include more of one thing in the output and
less of another, or can you change the quiet mode or can you add yet another
output mode?
A: Everyone will always have their own view of what's important to monitor.
The defaults are very sane and I have very little interest in changing this
any further.

Q: Why is my efficiency above/below 1.00?
A: Efficiency simply means how many shares you return for the amount of
bandwidth used. It does not correlate with efficient use of your hardware, and
is a measure of a combination of hardware speed, block luck, pool design and
other factors.

Q: What are the best parameters to pass for X pool/hardware/device.
A: Virtually always, the DEFAULT parameters give the best results. Most user
defined settings lead to worse performance. The ONLY thing most users should
need to set is the Intensity for GPUs.

Q: What happened to CPU mining?
A: Being increasingly irrelevant for most users, and a maintenance issue, it is
no longer under active development and will not be supported unless someone
steps up to help maintain it. No binary builds supporting CPU mining will be
released but CPU mining can be built into BFGMiner when it is compiled.

Q: GUI version?
A: No. The RPC interface makes it possible for someone else to write one
though.

Q: I'm having an issue. What debugging information should I provide?
A: Start BFGMiner with your regular commands and add -D -T --verbose and provide
the full startup output and a summary of your hardware, operating system, ATI
driver version and ATI stream version.

Q: Can I mine with BFGMiner on a Mac?
A: BFGMiner will compile on OS X, but the performance of GPU mining is
compromised due to the OpenCL implementation on OS X, there is no temperature or
fanspeed monitoring, and the cooling design of most Macs, despite having
powerful GPUs, will usually not cope with constant usage leading to a high risk
of thermal damage. It is highly recommended not to mine on a Mac unless it is to
a USB device.

Q: My network gets slower and slower and then dies for a minute?
A; Try the --net-delay option.

Q: How do I tune for P2Pool?
A: P2Pool has very rapid expiration of work and new blocks, it is suggested you
decrease intensity by 1 from your optimal value, and decrease GPU threads to 1
with -g 1. It is also recommended to use --failover-only since the work is
effectively like a different block chain. If mining with a Mini Rig, it is worth
adding the --bfl-range option.

Q: Are OpenCL kernels from other mining software useable in BFGMiner?
A: No, the APIs are slightly different between the different software and they
will not work.

Q: I run PHP on windows to access the API with the example miner.php. Why does
it fail when php is installed properly but I only get errors about Sockets not
working in the logs?
A: http://us.php.net/manual/en/sockets.installation.php

Q: What is a PGA?
A: At the moment, BFGMiner supports 5 FPGAs: BitForce, Icarus, ModMiner, X6500,
and ZTEX.
They are Field-Programmable Gate Arrays that have been programmed to do Bitcoin
mining. Since the acronym needs to be only 3 characters, the "Field-" part has
been skipped. "PGA" is also used for devices built with Application-Specific
Integrated Circuits (ASICs).

Q: What is an ASIC?
A: BFGMiner currently supports 2 ASICs: Avalon and BitForce SC devices. They are
Application Specify Integrated Circuit devices and provide the highest
performance per unit power due to being dedicated to only one purpose.

Q: How do I get my BFL/Icarus/Lancelot/Cairnsmore device to auto-recognise?
A: On Linux, if the /dev/ttyUSB* devices don't automatically appear, the only
thing that needs to be done is to load the driver for them:
BFL: sudo modprobe ftdi_sio vendor=0x0403 product=0x6014
Icarus: sudo modprobe pl2303 vendor=0x067b product=0x230
Lancelot: sudo modprobe ftdi_sio vendor=0x0403 product=0x6001
Cairnsmore: sudo modprobe ftdi_sio product=0x8350 vendor=0x0403
On windows you must install the pl2303 or ftdi driver required for the device
pl2303: http://prolificusa.com/pl-2303hx-drivers/
ftdi: http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm

Q: On Linux I can see the /dev/ttyUSB* devices for my ICA/BFL/MMQ FPGA, but
BFGMiner can't mine on them
A: Make sure you have the required priviledges to access the /dev/ttyUSB*
devices:
 sudo ls -las /dev/ttyUSB*
will give output like:
 0 crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 188, 0 2012-09-11 13:49 /dev/ttyUSB0
This means your account must have the group 'dialout' or root priviledges
To permanently give your account the 'dialout' group:
 sudo usermod -G dialout -a `whoami`
Then logout and back in again

Q: Can I mine scrypt with FPGAs or ASICs?
A: No.

Q: What is stratum and how do I use it?
A: Stratum is a protocol designed to reduce resources for mining pools at the
cost of keeping the miner in the dark and blindly transferring his mining
authority to the pool. It is a return to the problems of the old centralized
"getwork" protocol, but capable of scaling to hardware of any speed like the
standard GBT protocol. If a pool uses stratum instead of GBT, BFGMiner will
automatically detect it and switch to the support as advertised if it can.
Stratum uses direct TCP connections to the pool and thus it will NOT currently
work through a http proxy but will work via a socks proxy if you need to use
one. If you input the stratum port directly into your configuration, or use the
special prefix "stratum+tcp://" instead of "http://", BFGMiner will ONLY try to
use stratum protocol mining.

Q: Why don't the statistics add up: Accepted, Rejected, Stale, Hardware Errors,
Diff1 Work, etc. when mining greater than 1 difficulty shares?
A: As an example, if you look at 'Difficulty Accepted' in the RPC API, the number
of difficulty shares accepted does not usually exactly equal the amount of work
done to find them. If you are mining at 8 difficulty, then you would expect on
average to find one 8 difficulty share, per 8 single difficulty shares found.
However, the number is actually random and converges over time, it is an average,
not an exact value, thus you may find more or less than the expected average.
